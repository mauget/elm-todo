# elm-todo
This is a simple self-contained TODO list implemented in Elm. Being illustrative
of a beginning dip into Elm coding, it has no persistent model.

## Try
+ Click the index.html into your browser-of-choice.  

There is no styling in this initial rendition. The screen channels 1999, 
squeezed into the upper left corner. A Bootstrap 4 follow-on to this project will 
appear more normal. Baby steps.
