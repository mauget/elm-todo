# elm-todo
This is a simple self-contained TODO list implemented in Elm. Being illustrative
of a beginning dip into Elm coding, it has no persistent state.

## Try
+ Click the index.html into your browser-of-choice.  

There is no styling in this initial rendition. It illustrates
the Elm model-update-view cycle implemented as Elm pure functions.
